abstract="Background: Excessive gestational weight gain is common and associated with adverse outcomes both in the short and long term. Although traditional lifestyle-based interventions have shown to mitigate excess gestational weight gain, little is known about whether mobile Health (mHealth) apps can promote healthy weight gain, diet, and physical activity during pregnancy. Objective: The primary aim of the HealthyMoms trial is to determine the effectiveness of a smartphone app (HealthyMoms) for mitigating excess gestational weight gain during pregnancy. Secondary aims are to determine the effectiveness of the app on dietary habits, physical activity, body fatness, and glycemia during pregnancy. Methods: HealthyMoms is a two-arm randomized controlled trial. Women are being recruited at routine visits at the maternity clinics in Link{\"o}ping, Norrk{\"o}ping and Motala, Sweden. Women are randomized to the control or intervention group (n=150 per group). All women will receive standard care, and women in the intervention group will also receive the HealthyMoms smartphone app. Results: Recruitment of participants to the trial was initiated in October 2017, and 190 women have so far completed the baseline measurement. The baseline measures are estimated to be finalized in December 2019, and the follow-up measures are estimated to be completed in June 2020. Conclusions: This project will evaluate a novel smartphone app intervention integrated with existing maternity health care. If successful, it has great potential to be implemented nationally in order to promote healthy weight gain and health behaviors during pregnancy.

abstract="Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered a transitional state between normal and pathologic (eg, dementia) cognitive aging. Although its prognosis varies largely, the diagnosis carries the risk of causing uncertainty and overtreatment of older adults with MCI who may never progress to dementia. Decision aids help people become better informed and more involved in decision making by providing evidence-based information about options and possible outcomes and by assisting them in clarifying their personal values in relation to the decision to be made. Objective: This study aimed to incorporate features that best support values clarification and adjust the level of detail of a web-based decision aid for individuals with MCI. Methods: We conducted a rapid review to identify options to maintain or improve cognitive functions in individuals with MCI. The evidence was structured into a novel web-based decision aid designed in collaboration with digital specialists and graphic designers. Qualitative and user-centered evaluations were used to draw on users' knowledge, clarify values, and inform potential adoption in routine clinical practice. We invited clinicians, older adults with MCI, and their caregivers to evaluate the decision aid in 6 consecutive rounds, with new participants in each round. Quantitative data were collected using the Values Clarity and Informed subscales of the Decisional Conflict Scale, the System Usability Scale, the Ottawa Acceptability questionnaire, and a 5-point satisfaction rating scale. We verified their comprehension using a teach-back method and recorded usability issues. We recorded the audio and computer screen during the session. An inductive thematic qualitative analysis approach was used to identify and describe the issues that arose. After each round, an expert panel met to prioritize and find solutions to mitigate the issues. An integrated analysis was conducted to confirm our choices. Results: A total of 7 clinicians (social workers, nurses, family physicians, psychologists) and 12 older (≥60 years) community-dwelling individuals with MCI, half of them women, with education levels going from none to university diploma, were recruited and completed testing. The thematic analysis revealed 3 major issues. First, the user should be guided through the decision-making process by tailoring the presentation of options to users' priorities using the values clarification exercise. Second, its content should be simple, but not simplistic, notably by using information layering, plain language, and pictograms. Third, the interface should be intuitive and user friendly, utilize pop-up windows and information tips, avoid drop-down menus, and limit the need to scroll down. The quantitative assessments corroborated the qualitative findings. Conclusions: This project resulted in a promising web-based decision aid that can support decision making for MCI intervention, based on the personal values and preferences of the users. Further ongoing research will allow its implementation to be tested in clinical settings. ",

abstract="Background: Web-based interventions show promise in promoting a healthy lifestyle, but their effectiveness is hampered by high rates of nonusage. Predictors and reasons for (non)usage are not well known. Identifying which factors are related to usage contributes to the recognition of subgroups who benefit most from Web-based interventions and to the development of new strategies to increase usage. Objective: The aim of this mixed methods study was to explore patient, intervention, and study characteristics that facilitate or impede usage of a Web-based physical activity intervention for patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis. Methods: This study is part of a randomized controlled trial that investigated the effects of Web-based physical activity intervention. A total of 199 participants between 50-75 years of age with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to a Web-based intervention (n=100) or a waiting list (n=99). This mixed methods study used only data from the individuals allocated to the intervention group. Patients were defined as users if they completed at least 6 out of 9 modules. Logistic regression analyses with a stepwise backward selection procedure were executed to build a multivariate prediction usage model. For the qualitative part, semistructured interviews were conducted. Both inductive and deductive analyses were used to identify patterns in reported reasons for nonusage. Results: Of the 100 participants who received a password and username, 46 completed 6 modules or more. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that higher age (OR 0.94, P=.08) and the presence of a comorbidity (OR 0.33, P=.02) predicted nonusage. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the model was robust to changes in the usage parameter. Results from the interviews showed that a lack of personal guidance, insufficient motivation, presence of physical problems, and low mood were reasons for nonusage. In addition, the absence of human involvement was viewed as a disadvantage and it negatively impacted program usage. Factors that influenced usage positively were trust in the program, its reliability, functionality of the intervention, social support from family or friends, and commitment to the research team. Conclusions: In this mixed methods study, we found patient, intervention, and study factors that were important in the usage and nonusage of a Web-based PA intervention for patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis. Although the self-guided components offer several advantages, particularly in relation to costs, reach, and access, we found that older patients and participants with a comorbid condition need a more personal approach. For these groups the integration of Web-based interventions in a health care environment seems to be promising.

abstract = {Abstract Excess gestational weight gain is associated with short- and long-term pregnancy complications. Although a healthy diet and physical activity during pregnancy are recommended and shown to reduce the risk of complications and improve outcomes, adherence to these recommendations is low. The aims of this study were to explore women's view of nutrition and physical activity during pregnancy and to describe barriers and facilitators experienced in implementing physical activity and nutrition recommendations. In a substudy of the Be Healthy in Pregnancy randomized trial, 20 semistructured focus groups were conducted with 66 women randomized to the control group when they were between 16 and 24 weeks gestation. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded and thematically analysed. The results indicate that women felt motivated to be healthy for their baby, but competing priorities may take precedence. Participants described limited knowledge and access to information on safe physical activity in pregnancy and lacked the skills needed to operationalize both physical activity and dietary recommendations. Women's behaviours regarding diet and physical activity in pregnancy were highly influenced by their own and their peers' beliefs and values regarding how weight gain impacted their health during pregnancy. Pregnancy symptoms beyond women's control such as fatigue and nausea made physical activity and healthy eating more challenging. Counselling from care providers about nutrition and physical activity was perceived as minimal and ineffective. Future interventions should address improving counselling strategies and address individual's beliefs around nutrition and activity in pregnancy.},

  abstract= {While early studies on the effects of leisure time physical activity (LTPA) during pregnancy were concerned about possible harm to the mother or fetus, these fears have not been substantiated. Instead, a growing body of literature has documented several health benefits related to pregnancy LTPA. The purpose of this article was to synthesize evidence from epidemiological studies conducted in the United States, Canada, and Scandinavia on the benefits of LTPA and exercise during pregnancy with regard to maternal health, pregnancy outcomes, and child health. We focused on studies evaluating relations between pregnancy LTPA and gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, excessive gestational weight gain, birth weight, timing of delivery, and child body composition. The bulk of evidence supports beneficial effects of pregnancy LTPA on each outcome; however, most previous studies have been observational and used self-reported LTPA at only one or two time points in pregnancy. Limitations of the current knowledge base and suggestions for future research on the health benefits of LTPA during pregnancy are provided.},
